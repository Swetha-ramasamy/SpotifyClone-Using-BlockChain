## PROBLEM STATEMENT:
In today's digital music industry, artists and musicians often face significant challenges in monetizing their work while retaining control over their creative content. Traditional
streaming platforms impose hefty fees and intermediary charges, reducing the revenue that musicians rightfully deserve. Furthermore, centralized platforms maintain authority over
content distribution and profit allocation, limiting artists' autonomy and transparency.
In light of these challenges, there is a pressing need for a decentralized music streaming platform that empowers artists by providing them with a fair and transparent revenue model
while offering users a seamless and diverse music listening experience.
This platform must prioritize the seamless integration of blockchain technology to engender trust, integrity, and immutable record-keeping in content distribution, while concurrently delivering an unparalleled user experience through intuitive navigation, personalized content
curation, and robust search functionalities.
